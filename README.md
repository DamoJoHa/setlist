A semi-up-to-date live site can be found at https://setlist-30db6518e8ff.herokuapp.com/ . Rails app centered around connecting local communities to small acts and venues.  WIP, mostly functioning as a sandbox for anything I find myself interested in.

Current priorities or known issues:
* Inconsistent box sizing, esp. on event show page (look at the underlines)
* Map needs interactivity (pin information, etc)
* Map recoloring to add orange (?)
* Venue create/edit
* Act create/edit
* Venue request event creation with act (add confirmed column to event, default to false?), event edit
* Event belongs to user through venue or act? (which user gets primary ownership? does it matter?)
* Deletion dependencies aren't thought through
